# Snapshare

Snapshare is a picture sharing web application in (very) early development.

Currently, if you wish to share your personal pictures with your friends or family, you need either to :
- Use an online service and loose control on your private data 
- Use a too generic, non user-friendly system such as FTP

Snapshare is my modest attempt to solve this situation by providing an user friendly tool to share the best memories of you life with people you love.

Features will include :
- picture albums with customizable content
- easy upload and management of your pictures
- share your albums with your friends and family
- allow your users to add their own pictures to your albums 
- ...and more to come!
